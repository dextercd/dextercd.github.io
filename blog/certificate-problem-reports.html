<p>After learning a bit about EV certificates I decided to check out a few and see what they contain in the registration number field.
It was very confusing when the first EV registration number I looked at,
one used by rabobank[.]nl,
couldn't be found in KVK's database (the Dutch organisation registry).</p>
<p>After investigating some more,
it turned out that the certificate contained an old KVK number that had been deregistered,
making the certificate faulty.
I reported this to the certificate authority who started investigating.</p>
<h2 id="government-certificates">Government certificates</h2>
<p>I happen to have downloaded over 1 million certificates for a different project and began looking through those for other certificates with bad registration numbers.
Using this, I found a certificate used by noord-holland[.]nl with "Government Entity" as their registration number despite having a real registration number,
which is not allowed according to the EV guidelines:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For Government Entities that do not have a Registration Number or readily verifiable date of creation, the CA SHALL enter appropriate language to indicate that the Subject is a Government Entity. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was also reported to the respective certificate authority and they started their own investigation.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Both CAs reported back that they agreed the certificate was mississued,
had scheduled a revocation for the affected certificate,
would investigate the root cause of the mississuance,
and would see if other certificates were affected.</p>
<p>133 certificates ended up getting revoked for Rabobank, and 27 certificates used by various Dutch government sites also had to be revoked.</p>
<p>Since CAs depend on trust, these incident reports are public:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rabobank: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1891245">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1891245</a></li>
<li>Government Entities: <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1891531">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1891531</a> For this one, a discussion followed about the somewhat ambiguous wording in the requirements CAs are expected to follow.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was very interesting and encouraging to see how these, admittedly minor, issues got handled.</p>
<p>All certificates were revoked within 5 days of discovery, and a very thorough root cause analysis was done by both CAs.</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that the subscribers had to quickly replace their affected certificates.
This doesn't always go well, but, from reading these incident reports,
it wasn't a problem here. So, they definitely deserve praise too.</p>
